        \nHabits free up our mental capacity and energy by removing the need to make active
        decisions while performing habitual tasks. We can use the fact that our brains are
        constantly searching for behavioural patterns that can be automated to greatly improve
        our lives.\n

        \nTo achieve your life goals will require effort and perseverance, but to establish relevant
        micro habits to get you started does not. By breaking things down into the simplest possible
        daily activity that would take very little time and physical effort to complete, habit
        formation can be easy.\n

        \nFocus on the basics of habit creation: Make the activity simple, keep the trigger
        and reward consistent, and do it every day.\n

        \nHabits do not wait for Mondays or the first-of-the-months; all that matters is today.
        Your habit starts right now!
    </string>

    <string name="congratulations_activity_title">Congratulations!</string>

        Well done on completing seven weeks of your habit to %1$s every day!\n
        \nYou maintained a success rate of %2$s, and had a best running streak of %3$s.\n
        \nWhile 49 straight days should be sufficient to establish your habit, you\'re welcome to
        keep tracking your activity with EveryDayHabit. We\'ll shift your grid to display the most
        recent seven weeks only, but your stats will still be based on your progress since day one.
