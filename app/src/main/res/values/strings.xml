        \nGood habits serve to create routine, order and efficiency and bad habits can lock us into
        negative patterns of behaviour.\n
        \nMaking or breaking a habit takes conscious mental effort and perseverance, but the
        pay off can be massive. Think what it is that you want to achieve, reduce it to the
        simplest possible daily activity that would take very little time and physical effort to
        complete. Now think of something in your daily routine that can act as a trigger for
        performing your new habit and complete the following:\n
    </string>
    <string name="new_habit_2">Every day, I am going toâ€¦\n</string>
    <string name="new_habit_notify_title">Notification Time</string>
    <string name="new_habit_notify">Set a daily reminder to log your progress.
        (Don\'t rely on this as a trigger to perform your habit)\n</string>
